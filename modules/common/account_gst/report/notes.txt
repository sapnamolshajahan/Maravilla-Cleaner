use the gst control accounts as the basis for the report

note - each tax type on an invoice creates a separate account_move_line

for each account_mmove_line:
	get the move_id.line_ids
	for line in line_ids:
		if line.invoice_id:
			do build_invoice_line
		else:
			for move lines sum debit - credit, tax amount by nz_tax_type
			add to dictionary
			

build_invoice_line
	from invoice_id link to account_invoice_tax and get by tax amount for this tax type (from source account_move_line)
	by invoice_line
		get tax from invoice_line_tax and use line amount to prorate tax_amount for this line
		get line amount excl tax from line
	
	check that the pro-ration adds to the total amount from the account_move_line and deal with any rounding issues
