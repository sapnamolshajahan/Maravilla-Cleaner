Site Ribbon
===========

Add a text ribbon on the left hand side if the _ribbon.name_ attribute is defined in the configuration file:

    [site_ribbon]

    name = Some Text
    colour = #f0f0f0
    background = rgba(255,0,0,.6)

_colour_ and _background_ entries are optional. Their defaults values are as shown above: grey and transparent red.
