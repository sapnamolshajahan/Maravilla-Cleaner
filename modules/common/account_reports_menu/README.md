# Purpose

This is a very simple module provided to simplify dependency in other modules. 
This module adds a new top-level accounting menu: Additional Reports. 
This menu is then used by a range of other OptimySME modules that add 
reports into Odoo.

NOTE - if using Odoo Enterprise, also install account_reports_enterprise which moves this menu
into the correct accounting menu for Enterprise.
